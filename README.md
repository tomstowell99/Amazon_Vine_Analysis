# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Purpose
   I chose the us_video_games data set as the data I wanted to review. The purpose of reviewing the data was to see if those who our
   members of Vine are more likely to give a positive review. Our theory is that yes they would give a better review because
   they receive the prodcuts they are reviewing for free.
   
 ## Results
    We pulled the data from the Amazon site. We pared the data down a bit. First we eliminated reviews that had less than 20 votes 
    where users found the reviews helpful. Second we eliminated those reviews where there were not at least 50% of voters who found
    the review helpful. Lastly we segregated the reviews done by Vine users from those of all other reviews.
   
   ### Vine Users
   
    * There were 94 Vine user reviews.
    * In 48 of those reviews they gave a full five star rating
    * This equated to 51% of the Vine users giving a five star review.
