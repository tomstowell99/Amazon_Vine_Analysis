# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Purpose
   I chose the us_video_games data set as the data I wanted to review. The purpose of reviewing the data was to see if those who our
   members of Vine are more likely to give a positive review. Our theory is that yes they would give a better review because
   they receive the prodcuts they are reviewing for free.
   
 ## Results
    We pulled the data from the Amazon site. We pared the data down a bit. First we eliminated reviews that had less than 20 votes 
    where users found the reviews helpful. Second we eliminated those reviews where there were not at least 50% of voters who found
    the review helpful. Lastly we segregated the reviews done by Vine users from those of all other reviews.
   
   ### Vine Users
   
    - There were 94 Vine user reviews.
    - In 48 of those reviews they gave a full five star rating
    - This equated to 51% of the Vine users giving a five star review.

### Non Vine Users
   
   - There were 40,471 non-Vine user reviews
   - 15,663 of those reviewers gave the full five star rating
   - This equated to 39% of non-Vine users giving the five star review.

### Summary
   From the data. It appears that there is a bias from Vine users to give a five star ranking (51%) than there is
   with the non_vine users (39%)
   
   Optional reporting that could be done. The statistical sample size for Vine users was small. We should run a full
   correlation report on the entire population. This could show us over all the ratings if Vine users generally rank
   the product they recieve higher than other users. Over all ratings.
